[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lschricke/symfony-strict-route-collection.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lschricke/symfony-strict-route-collection)

This package offers a stricter version of the Symfony\\Component\\Routing\\RouteCollection where you cannot add a Route with a name that is already registered, preventing you to overwrite an existing Route name by mistake.
